# powertac-replayer

## Introduction

The project "Replayer" was created at the Westf√§lische Hochschule in Gelsenkirchen (Germany).

It is a web front-end which can replay finished games of the simulation platform Power TAC (http://www.powertac.org/).

The replayer was based on the Power TAC visualizer (https://github.com/powertac/visualizer).

The package "org.powertac.replayer" and its subdirectories contain the new developed replayer classes.
The package "org.powertac.visualizer" and its subdirectories contain the visualizer classes from Power TAC visualizer which was used in replayer package.

## Getting started

In directory "powertac-replayer/visualizer" you can build the replayer by "mvn clean install" and run it with "mvn jetty:run". 
If everything works well, the message "Jetty Server started" will appear in your console output. 
Replayer will be located at localhost:8080/visualizer/.

The replayer requires the ".state" or ".tar.gz" log files.These files can be uploaded through a File Upload-component or over the 
webflow "replayer". The webflow "replayer" expects the log file url. 
(for example "http://localhost:8080/visualizer/app/replayer?logurl=http://wolf-08.fbk.eur.nl/log/game-128-sim-logs.tar.gz")
